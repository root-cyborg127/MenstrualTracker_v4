## 📝 Objective

The primary objective of the Menstrual Cycle Tracker is to empower individuals with a practical and user-friendly tool for effectively managing and comprehending their menstrual cycles. This software application aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of menstrual patterns, enabling users to anticipate crucial events within their menstrual cycles, including menstruation, ovulation, and fertility windows. By offering a clear and organized schedule of future menstrual and ovulation dates, the program enables users to plan their daily lives with greater accuracy, taking into account their unique reproductive health data.

## 🔬 Logic

The program operates with a logical framework:

- **Cycle Length Calculation**: To calculate future menstruation dates, the program adds the length of the previous menstrual cycle to the date of the last period, accounting for month transitions.

- **Period End Date**: It determines when a period will end by adding the length of the menstrual period to the start date, adjusting for month transitions.

- **Ovulation Start Date**: The program calculates the ovulation start date by adding ten days to the start date of the menstrual cycle, accounting for month transitions.

- **Ovulation End Date**: Ovulation usually lasts for a few days, and the program calculates the ovulation end date by adding six days to the ovulation start date, with adjustments for month transitions.

- **Date Verification**: When a user inputs a specific date for verification, the program compares this date to the calculated menstrual and ovulation dates. It checks if the input date falls within the range of predicted dates, helping determine alignment with menstrual cycle predictions.
